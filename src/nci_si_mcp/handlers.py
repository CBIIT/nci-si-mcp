    `direction` `out` follows `child`, `role` and `association` edges, `in`
    follows `parent`, `inverse_role` and `inverse_association` edges, and
    `both` follows all six. The include flags switch hierarchy, role and
    association edges off. `edge_types` narrows the walk to the listed
    types; naming a type that the direction or the include flags exclude
    is an `invalid_request`. It is also the only way to get `descendant`
    edges (direction `out` or `both`, hierarchy included), which link each
    start code directly to every descendant that EVS places within
    `max_depth` levels. EVS gives a descendant one level, which can be
    deeper than its shortest path, so `descendant` edges can miss concepts
    that a `child` walk of the same depth reaches: up to a few percent at
    depth 2, and up to a third at depth 3 or 4, depending on the concept.
    Use `child` edges when every concept within `max_depth` is needed.
    `relationship_names` filters role and association edges by name, ignoring
    case, for example `Disease_Has_Finding`. Hierarchy edges remain included
    and carry no invented relationship name.

    Limits are clamped to depth 4, 1,000 nodes and 5,000 edges, and the
    result reports the effective `max_depth`, `max_nodes` and `max_edges`.
    `budget_per_kind` optionally limits new nodes per relationship kind,
    clamped to 1,000. Kinds take turns across the whole frontier at each
    depth; starts count against the global node limit, and edges to
    existing nodes spend no kind allowance. Mixed-kind truncation includes
    `perKind` records. A traversal shares 200 HTTP attempts across release
    discovery, retries and split batches. Exhaustion before any graph is
    available returns `bound_exceeded`; otherwise it returns a partial graph
    with `requests` truncation unless an earlier bound already dropped something.
    An exhausted kind uses `kind_budget`. Unread kinds report a lower-bound
    omitted count of zero with `exact: false` when their relation count is unknown.
    Nearer nodes claim the limits before farther ones. `truncation` is
    `{occurred: false}` unless something was dropped. It then names the
    first `bound` that still omits something: `depth`, `nodes`, `edges`, `kind_budget`,
    `requests`, or `upstream_cap`, when the relations or descendants of a concept
    were too large for the EVS response limit to read, which raising the
    node and edge limits does not help (for descendants, a smaller
    `max_depth` can). `limit` is that bound's value, `reached` what had
    been counted, and `omitted` a lower bound on nodes, edges or unread work
    left out; `exact` is false, since what lies beyond a dropped
    item was never read. A bounded final-frontier check of selected relation lists
    reports `depth` only when unseen targets remain, counting distinct targets
    one level further. Leaves and cycles to returned nodes are complete.
    The check spends the same request budget; an earlier bound still wins.
    A reported global node cut skips it; kinds already truncated are excluded.
    Descendant checks use final child lists. Inverse kinds never read final lists
    only to count continuation: each selected inverse kind at a nonempty frontier reports
    depth with omitted=0 and exact=false, without claiming a leaf or continuation.
    Every edge connects two nodes of the result. Every node and edge
    carries a `provenance` record: the release of the configured channel all data is read
    from, and how the item was reached: its `depth` (an edge has that of
    the node it reaches), and for any item but the start codes the
    `relationship` `{kind, code?, name?}` (a role or association has a
    name and a code when upstream supplies one, a hierarchy link only its kind),
    the `direction` in which that edge type is followed and the `polarity`,
    `negative` for configured NCIt exclusion roles by code (R135 to R142 by
    default). A start code that release does not contain returns `not_found`."""
