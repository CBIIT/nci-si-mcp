## evs-polarity

**Publish stable relationship polarity by code**

Platform requirement/operation: **E-4; OP-E02**.
Specification requirements: `get_concept_neighborhood-2`, `list_relationships-2`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The catalogue exposes relationship codes and names; the exclusion scenario deliberately gives misleading names. That crafted scenario is a regression probe, not an observed production mislabelling.

**Reproduction.** Read the pinned role catalogue (OP-E02); run the traversal/exclusions scenario to distinguish classification by code from name matching.

**Expected.** Publish a versioned machine-readable exclusion/polarity classification keyed by stable relationship code.

**Impact.** A name-based inference can include excluded concepts in a cohort.

**Workaround.** Use the configured exclusion code set; fail closed if the release catalogue lacks a required code.

**Acceptance criteria.** Renaming a relationship does not change polarity; positive and negative fixtures produce the same code-based classification as the published catalogue.

## evs-semantic

**Platform semantic retrieval and local-index retirement**

Platform requirement/operation: **E-9**.
Specification requirements: `search_concepts-3`, `search_concepts-5`, `search_concepts-8`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The furnished implementation performs embedding semantic/hybrid retrieval locally. The EVS team's response relayed on 8 October 2026 confirms that /search type controls lexical matching, while structured and ontology/relationship-aware retrieval, including SPARQL, are also available. Graph semantics do not establish an equivalent embedding-ranked operation; see team-responses-2026-10-08.md.

**Reproduction.** Compare lexical OP-E08 with semantic/hybrid search using an activated full index and then without an index; use the recorded full-corpus evaluation, not fixture timing, for quality floors.

**Expected.** Provide release-addressable semantic/hybrid results, scores, paging, provenance and declared ranking behavior.

**Impact.** Operators currently distribute an embedding model and full index and maintain release compatibility.

**Workaround.** Keep the local index; refuse missing or mismatched builds rather than substituting lexical results.

**Acceptance criteria.** Before retiring the local index, the replacement passes the tool contracts and full-corpus quality and latency evaluation on the same queries and release; sample-only scores cannot justify retirement.

## evs-retired

**Consistent active and retired search filters**

Platform requirement/operation: **OP-E08; A8.3; A9.3**.
Specification requirements: `search_concepts-6`, `search_concepts-7`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The issue records DEFAULT and true rejected by conceptStatus (400), and Retired_Concept accepted but ignored for GO. The retained recordings cover NCIt retired-only and the unfiltered GO baseline, not those failed probes.

**Reproduction.** Compare GO obsolete search with conceptStatus omitted, Retired_Concept, and the listing's retiredStatusValue=true; try DEFAULT for NCIt. These are the issue's 2 October observations, not newly executed probes.

**Expected.** An active filter or DEFAULT selection, plus retired-only selection using each terminology's documented status value.

**Impact.** An exclude-retired request cannot be served, and retired-only is unavailable for affected non-NCIt terminologies.

**Workaround.** Offer include/only, never exclude; refuse retired-only where the status cannot be selected.

**Acceptance criteria.** Active-only omits every retired result; retired-only returns no active result across NCIt and GO, with correct totals and continuation pages.

## evs-licence

**Carry upstream licence text with concepts and maps**

Platform requirement/operation: **OP-E05; OP-E20; A7.3; X-19**.
Specification requirements: `X-19`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The listing supplies metadata.licenseText; content does not consistently carry it. license/attributed is a crafted future answer, not proof of a served capability.

**Reproduction.** Compare the licensed terminology listing with a concept/map response; exercise license/attributed for the requested passthrough shape.

**Expected.** Include upstream licence and attribution text per concept/map, or once per response with an unambiguous association.

**Impact.** Clients reading content alone cannot receive the terms supplied only by a separate listing.

**Workaround.** Pass through text actually retrieved; the MCP server maintains no licence text of its own and does not invent it.

**Acceptance criteria.** Every affected content response delivers the platform's exact text through the tool unchanged, without exposing a licence credential.

## evs-pinned-forms

**Address subset, mapset and FHIR content states explicitly**

Platform requirement/operation: **OP-E06; OP-E23; OP-E24; OP-E25; OP-F05**.
Specification requirements: `X-1`, `X-2`, `X-3`, `expand_value_set-1`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The request register records the missing pinned subset path and rejected FHIR system-version form; mapsets have heterogeneous versions, not uniformly NCIt releases.

**Reproduction.** Use the register's served and prescribed forms side by side, including an unavailable release; preserve mapset-specific version semantics.

**Expected.** Document and serve explicit content-state selection and report the selected state in each payload.

**Impact.** Unpinned operations cannot retrieve an older requested state after the platform moves.

**Workaround.** The approved unpinned fallback verifies the payload's reported release and fails on mismatch; a mapset's own version is never relabelled as a verified NCIt release.

**Acceptance criteria.** Known pins return that exact state, unknown pins fail closed, and mixed or missing identities cannot masquerade as the requested release.

## evs-inactive-expansion

**Define inactive membership and expansion paging**

Platform requirement/operation: **OP-F05; A8.3; A9.5**.
Specification requirements: `expand_value_set-1`, `expand_value_set-2`.
Source discussion: [issue evidence](https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-si-mcp/issues/42).

**Observation.** The recorded expansion ignores count, offset and activeOnly. Whether production ever emits inactive members marked contains.inactive remains unknown; valueset/inactive-members crafts that case.

**Reproduction.** Compare expansion with and without count/offset/activeOnly; request an upstream example known to include an inactive member.

**Expected.** State whether inactive members are returned, mark them explicitly, and honor or explicitly document pagination/filter behavior.

**Impact.** Live evidence cannot currently demonstrate inactive filtering; full expansions require local slicing.

**Workaround.** Filter only members marked inactive and slice the retrieved expansion locally; never issue one lookup per member.

**Acceptance criteria.** A provided inactive-member example is excluded by activeOnly and included otherwise, with consistent totals/pages and bounded request counts.
