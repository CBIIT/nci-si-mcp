# Change log of the specification and the acceptance suite

The NCI SI MCP project coordinator is the code owner of `spec/` and `acceptance/`.

From the furnished tag, every change to `spec/` or to the suite is an entry here with three
things: the change, the requirement it serves, and its approval reference, the written approval of
the branch chief or a delegate ([spec/acceptance.md](../spec/acceptance.md)). Each approved
release of the suite has its digest in [approved.yaml](approved.yaml); a report from any other
tree renders MODIFIED.

## Unreleased: before the furnished tag

Changes until then are development under the plan and need no approval reference. The suite is
under construction: the per-tool tests, the protocol gates, the prompts and resources, and the
fixture set pinned to NCIt 26.09d.

<!-- The shape of a release, from the furnished tag on:

## v1.0.0: <date>

Digest: <64 hex characters, as in approved.yaml>

- <the change> (serves <requirement id>; approval: <reference>)
-->
