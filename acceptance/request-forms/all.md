# Upstream request forms, for every team

Generated from `acceptance/fixtures/manifest.yaml` by `pdm run acceptance-register`; do not edit by hand.

The upstream requests the acceptance suite's fixtures answer, each with the platform operation it
serves (its `OP-` id in the programme's operation inventory, or the requirement where the
operation is missing) and why
it has this form. They are initial versions, from the published API documentation and live checks
where the operation exists and a draft where it does not, furnished for the EVS, caDSR and Shared SI
teams to refine as needed, each change with the approval of the branch chief or a delegate.

Two kinds of request are answered whatever their form: EVS concept requests, by rules over one
recording per concept (below), and requests whose parameters the service is shown to ignore.

## Operations without a pinned form upstream

These are served unpinned today. The verified fallback is approved for the prototype: the tool
calls the unpinned form, compares the release the payload reports with the one requested, and
fails closed on a difference. NCI's approval under EVS SOW v2.1 item 5 is taken from this list. A
mapset that reports a version of its own, not an NCIt release, cannot be verified that way: it is a
content state of its own, named in provenance and not presented as release-verified.

| Operation | Prescribed form (crafted) | Served form (recorded) | Release reported |
|---|---|---|---|
| OP-E06 | `GET evs /api/v1/subset/ncit_26.09d/C177537` | `GET evs /api/v1/subset/ncit/C177537` | 26.09d |

## caDSR: no registry release, and JSON only when asked for

caDSR publishes no registry release (C-1, A3.8.1): every caDSR form below is served without one,
the path the inventory names for it (OP-C08) answers 404, and the export's date is the registry's
only content state (A3.8.2). The forms the inventory names with `registryRelease` are crafted in
`cadsr/with-registry-release`. Every caDSR request names `Accept: application/json`, which the
contracts prescribe (M3.2): without it the API answers HTTP 200 with HTML, recorded for two paths,
and the fixture naming the most headers a request carries answers it. A refusal of the arguments
and an unknown data element both come back as HTTP 200, with `apiResponse` saying so (X-15).

## Shared SI: graph identities, and the query text

The Shared SI Service names no release (S-1, S-2): the NCIt and caDSR graphs each carry an
untyped `dc:date`, in two formats, and only NCIt an `owl:versionInfo`; the identity query below
reads them (A3.7.1). For the SPARQL endpoint the suite prescribes the query text: each query
below is matched with runs of whitespace collapsed, sent as a form-encoded POST (a direct POST
of the query is refused) asking for `application/sparql-results+json`. Its `LIMIT` is the tool's
maximum + 1, so that the answer shows whether more exist. A team may propose another form here,
as for every form. The façade answers HTML unless `Accept: application/json` is sent, and a
missing argument with HTTP 200 (X-15).

## Concept requests answered by rule

One recording per concept answers each projection (`include`) and relation list of that concept
it covers, and a batch is composed from the recordings of the concepts it names
(`acceptance/src/nci_si_acceptance/concepts.py`).

| Operations | Form |
|---|---|
| OP-E05 | `GET /api/v1/concept/{terminology}_{release}/{code}?include=…` |
| OP-E07 | `GET /api/v1/concept/{terminology}_{release}?list=…&include=…`, ≤ 1,000 codes |
| OP-E10, E11, E14 to E17, E20 | `GET /api/v1/concept/{terminology}_{release}/{code}/{relation}` |

## Scenarios

Each scenario provokes one case; its fixtures answer before the ordinary
ones while a test selects it. A recorded fixture is what the service answers today. A crafted one
stands in for a case the service does not produce on demand, under the requirement it names, and
answers the ordinary forms above.

### `release/unknown`

Every content path of `ncit_99.99z` answers 404. Recorded.

Each request: An unknown release answers 404 on every content path: the server fails closed.

| Operation | Request | Expected | Fixture |
|---|---|---|---|

| OP-E06 | `GET evs /api/v1/metadata/ncit_99.99z/properties` | 404; every parameter ignored | `scenarios/release/unknown/property-catalogue.json` |

### `release/mismatch`

Every payload that reports the pinned release names 26.08e instead, the unpinned forms included; release discovery is left as recorded. Crafted, 162 fixtures, for A3.4: the content served names another release than the one requested.

### `release/two-latest`

A weekly and a monthly row are both `latest`, the weekly first in every list; each form of the release query gives a channel the same release. Crafted, 4 fixtures, for A3.6.1-A3.6.3: two releases carry latest at once, one per channel.

### `release/duplicate-tag`

Two releases are both latest with the monthly tag; the monthly query and the listing name both. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for A3.6.3: a release with duplicate tags fails closed.

### `batch/silent-drop`

A code EVS does not know is left out of a batch. Recorded.

| Operation | Request | Expected | Rationale | Fixture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OP-E07 | `GET evs /api/v1/concept/ncit_26.09d/CBOGUS999999?include=full` | 404 | A code EVS does not know: a batch leaves it out without a signal (E-5). | `scenarios/batch/silent-drop/concepts/CBOGUS999999.json` |

### `retired/with-replacement`

C154421 is retired with a replacement, and one bad code fails a batch. Recorded.

| Operation | Request | Expected | Rationale | Fixture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OP-E05 | `GET evs /api/v1/concept/ncit_26.09d/C154421?include=full` | 200 | A retired concept (A8). | `scenarios/retired/with-replacement/concepts/C154421.json` |
| OP-E21 | `GET evs /api/v1/history/ncit_26.09d/C154421/replacements` | 200 | A retired code with its replacement. | `scenarios/retired/with-replacement/replacement.json` |
| OP-E21 | `GET evs /api/v1/history/ncit_26.09d/replacements?list=C154421` | 200 | The batch form for the retired code. | `scenarios/retired/with-replacement/replacements.json` |
| OP-E21 | `GET evs /api/v1/history/ncit_26.09d/replacements?list=C154421,C4817` | 200 | A batch of a retired and an active code, answered per code. | `scenarios/retired/with-replacement/replacements-with-active.json` |
| OP-E21 | `GET evs /api/v1/history/ncit_26.09d/replacements?list=C154421,CBOGUS999999` | 404 | One unknown code fails the whole batch (404). | `scenarios/retired/with-replacement/replacements-with-unknown.json` |

### `traversal/deep-fanout`

One root has 1,001 children, and a chain runs deeper than depth 4 from its first child, C99000001 (the node maximum is reached at depth 1 from the root). Crafted, 1,007 fixtures, for A5.1-A5.4: descendants beyond the depth and node bounds.

### `traversal/exclusions`

Exclusion roles are named like positive ones, and two the other way. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for A5.6, A5.7, E-4: polarity by relationship code, not by name.

### `traversal/starvation`

One concept has 300 roles and 2 associations, and another 300 associations and 2 roles, to the same targets. Crafted, 304 fixtures, for A5.5: a budget per relationship kind; no kind starved.

### `valueset/inactive-members`

Two members of value set C85492 are marked inactive (FHIR contains.inactive), in both forms of its expansion. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for A8.3: activeOnly leaves out the members an expansion marks inactive. EVS was never seen to mark one, so against live EVS activeOnly cannot be shown to do anything (an upstream question, #42).

### `relationships/exclusion-missing`

The role catalogue lacks R135, a code of the exclusion set. Crafted, 1 fixture, for A5.7: a release whose catalogue lacks R135, of the exclusion set, fails closed.

### `upstream/unavailable`

Every upstream request, whatever its surface and path, gets a closed connection, then 503, then no answer within the timeout. Crafted, 7 fixtures, for A2.5, A5.3: bounded retries, counted, then a structured error.

### `upstream/rate-limited`

429 with `Retry-After` on the release query, then the answer. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for E-7, P-1: back-off honoured and counted.

### `license/restricted`

403 without the licence key; invented content with it. Recorded. Crafted, 7 fixtures, for A7.5: EVS refuses every request for mdr without the licence key. Crafted, 8 fixtures, for E-7, A7.5: the licence key sent from configuration.

| Operation | Request | Expected | Rationale | Fixture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A7.5 | `GET evs /api/v1/concept/mdr_29_0/10000000?include=summary` | 403; every parameter ignored | EVS refuses mdr without the X-EVSRESTAPI-License-Key header (403). | `scenarios/license/restricted/refused.json` |

### `cadsr/with-registry-release`

caDSR publishes a registry release: /registry/releases names one, and a data element asked with it is answered with the release echoed (C-1). Crafted, 3 fixtures, for C-1: a published registry release, named in every answer and accepted on every content call.

### `cadsr/credentialed`

The server holds caDSR credentials: contexts and CDE Match answer to the contracts, where the API refuses an anonymous caller (401). Crafted, 1 fixture, for OP-M01, A9.3: CDE Match to its 2.0 contract, which refuses an anonymous caller since 3 October 2026 at the latest (401, recorded/cadsr/cde-match-refused*.json); the array the call of 10 September sent. Crafted, 1 fixture, for OP-M01, A9.3: CDE Match to its 2.0 contract for a second entity; the array the call of 10 September sent. Crafted, 1 fixture, for OP-M01, A9.3: CDE Match to its 2.0 contract for a second entity. Crafted, 1 fixture, for OP-M01, A9.3: CDE Match to its 2.0 contract, which refuses an anonymous caller since 3 October 2026 at the latest (401, recorded/cadsr/cde-match-refused*.json). Crafted, 1 fixture, for OP-C13, A9.3: the context list to the lists-of-values contract, which refuses an anonymous caller (401, recorded/cadsr/context-names-refused.json).

### `cadsr/match-timeout`

vmMatch answers later than the match timeout the scenario sets. Crafted, 1 fixture, for A2.5: matching slower than its declared timeout is a timeout error; the array the call of 10 September sent. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for A2.5: matching slower than its declared timeout is a timeout error.

### `cadsr/html-for-json`

A data element asked for with Accept: application/json is answered with the HTML caDSR sends to a request without it. Crafted, 1 fixture, for X-15: HTML where JSON was asked for is an upstream error.

### `upstream/masked-error`

Every request to the Shared SI façade and to the caDSR API is answered with HTTP 200 and an apiResponse of type E, the failure each sends inside a success. Crafted, 2 fixtures, for X-15: an error envelope in an HTTP 200 is an upstream error.

### `ssis/query-rejected`

Every SPARQL query is refused by the Shared SI Service's inspection layer: HTTP 403 with an HTML body. Crafted, 1 fixture, for X-15: HTML where JSON was asked for is an upstream error.
