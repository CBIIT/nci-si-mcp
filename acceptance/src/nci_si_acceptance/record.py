"""Record the fixture set from the live services, as the manifest says.

    pdm run acceptance-record [--fixtures DIR]

Every request the manifest lists under `record.requests` is made live, without a licence
key or credentials, and becomes a recorded fixture, dated today. A request is a GET with
`Accept: application/json` unless its entry gives a `method`, a JSON `body` and the
`headers` to send: those it gives are sent alone and are part of the fixture, so that the
fixture server answers only a request that carries them. Each concept under
`record.concepts` is recorded once, at the include it is listed under, in
`recorded/evs/concepts/`. Each entry under
`record.derived` becomes a crafted fixture for the request form a requirement prescribes
where EVS does not answer it yet, carrying the answer of a recording.
Nothing is written unless all of this holds:

- the live monthly NCIt release is the one the manifest pins (`evs.release`):
  re-pinning is a re-recording under change control;
- every request is answered, with the status its entry expects (`status`, 200 unless
  given), and every concept recording is one the fixture server accepts;
- every sample under `record.samples`, asked live, equals the answer the concept
  rules compose from the new recordings, a batch compared code by code because EVS
  keeps no order;
- every derived fixture comes from a recording the manifest makes, of the pinned
  release where the answer names one;
- every file under the recorded surfaces, and every derived fixture, is one the
  manifest produces.
