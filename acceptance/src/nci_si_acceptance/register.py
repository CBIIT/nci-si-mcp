"""The register of upstream request forms, generated from the manifest.

    pdm run acceptance-register [--fixtures DIR]

The government furnishes an initial form for every platform operation the tools rest
on: from the published API documentation and what was verified live where the
operation exists, and a draft naming its requirement where it does not. The manifest
holds each form with its operation and rationale; this writes the readable register
from it, one view for each team (EVS, caDSR, the Shared SI Service) and one for all
(`acceptance/request-forms/`). A self-test fails when the files are not current.

The upstream requests the acceptance suite's fixtures answer, each with the platform operation it

it has this form. They are initial versions, from the published API documentation and live checks
where the operation exists and a draft where it does not, furnished for the EVS, caDSR and Shared SI
teams to refine as needed, each change with the approval of the branch chief or a delegate.

Two kinds of request are answered whatever their form: EVS concept requests, by rules over one
recording per concept (below), and requests whose parameters the service is shown to ignore.
"""

## Concept requests answered by rule

One recording per concept answers each projection (`include`) and relation list of that concept
it covers, and a batch is composed from the recordings of the concepts it names
(`acceptance/src/nci_si_acceptance/concepts.py`).

| Operations | Form |
|---|---|
| OP-E05 | `GET /api/v1/concept/{terminology}_{release}/{code}?include=…` |

## Scenarios

Each scenario provokes one case; its fixtures answer before the ordinary
ones while a test selects it. A recorded fixture is what the service answers today. A crafted one
stands in for a case the service does not produce on demand, under the requirement it names, and
answers the ordinary forms above.
"""
CADSR = """\
## caDSR: no registry release, and JSON only when asked for

caDSR publishes no registry release (C-1, A3.8.1): every caDSR form below is served without one,
the path the inventory names for it (OP-C08) answers 404, and the export's date is the registry's
only content state (A3.8.2). The forms the inventory names with `registryRelease` are crafted in
`cadsr/with-registry-release`. Every caDSR request names `Accept: application/json`, which the
contracts prescribe (M3.2): without it the API answers HTTP 200 with HTML, recorded for two paths,
and the fixture naming the most headers a request carries answers it. A refusal of the arguments
and an unknown data element both come back as HTTP 200, with `apiResponse` saying so (X-15).
"""
SSIS = """\
## Shared SI: graph identities, and the query text

The Shared SI Service names no release (S-1, S-2): the NCIt and caDSR graphs each carry an
untyped `dc:date`, in two formats, and only NCIt an `owl:versionInfo`; the identity query below
reads them (A3.7.1). For the SPARQL endpoint the suite prescribes the query text: each query
below is matched with runs of whitespace collapsed, sent as a form-encoded POST (a direct POST
of the query is refused) asking for `application/sparql-results+json`. Its `LIMIT` is the tool's
maximum + 1, so that the answer shows whether more exist. A team may propose another form here,
as for every form. The façade answers HTML unless `Accept: application/json` is sent, and a
missing argument with HTTP 200 (X-15).
"""
FALLBACK = """\
## Operations without a pinned form upstream

These are served unpinned today. The verified fallback is approved for the prototype: the tool
calls the unpinned form, compares the release the payload reports with the one requested, and
fails closed on a difference. NCI's approval under EVS SOW v2.1 item 5 is taken from this list. A
mapset that reports a version of its own, not an NCIt release, cannot be verified that way: it is a
content state of its own, named in provenance and not presented as release-verified.
