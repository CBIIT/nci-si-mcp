"""An upstream that answers from fixtures and records every request it receives.

The server under test is pointed at this server instead of the live services, one
path prefix per upstream surface (`/evs`, `/cadsr`, ...). Every request is recorded,
answered or not, whatever its method:

    GET    /_log    the requests received since the last reset, as JSON
    DELETE /_log    reset: clear the log and rewind every response sequence

A request is answered by the fixture whose surface, method, path, query parameters,
headers and body match it. Paths and values are compared decoded, the order of
different parameters does not matter, and repeated values of one parameter keep their
order. Bodies are compared as parsed JSON where they are JSON, and otherwise as text
with runs of whitespace collapsed. A form-encoded body (`Content-Type:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, a SPARQL query) is compared field by field, decoded,
each value with runs of whitespace collapsed, and also as sent; its fixture names it as
`form`, each field with its text. A fixture without a `body` or `form` matches any request
body. A parameter the live service is shown to ignore may be declared under
`ignored`, with the evidence; it is then left out of the match, and `"*"` leaves out
every parameter (an unknown release answers 404 whatever is asked; a fault fixture
fails whatever is asked), the fixture's `params` then only recording what was asked
when it was captured. A fixture's `headers` must be present with those values,
header names in any case; among the fixtures of one path in one layer (below), the one
naming the most headers the request carries answers (a licence key granted, else the
refusal), and between header sets of the same size the first by name. A request that
no fixture answers gets HTTP 501.

A fixture is a JSON file:

    {
      "kind": "recorded",                 # or "crafted"
      "recorded_on": "2026-10-02",        # recorded: when it was captured
      "requirement": "C-1",               # crafted: the requirement it stands in for
      "request": {"surface": "evs", "method": "GET", "path": "/api/v1/version",
                  "params": {"include": ["summary"]}, "body": "...",
                  "form": {"query": "SELECT ..."},     # in place of body: a form
                  "headers": {"X-EVSRESTAPI-License-Key": "..."},
                  "ignored": {"count": "the evidence that the service ignores it"}},
      "response": {"status": 200, "headers": {}, "body": {...}}
    }

A recorded fixture's request never carries the EVS licence key: what EVS serves without
it is public, and licensed content, which EVS refuses without it (403), is never recorded.

`responses` (a list) in place of `response` answers successive requests in order,
the last one repeating; the sequence starts again at each reset. A response may wait
`delay_seconds` before it is sent, or be the fault `{"fault": "close"}`: the
connection is closed without an answer. That stands in for an unreachable service as
far as a fixture can; a refused connection cannot be produced per request. A string
`body` is sent as HTML, any other body as JSON, and no body as nothing. The fixture's
headers are sent too and override the content type; headers that frame the message
(`Content-Length`, ...) are the server's and are refused.

A scenario fixture whose path is `*` answers every request of its surface and method that
no other fixture of its scenario answers, whatever its parameters, headers and body: the
service as a whole unavailable. It matches on nothing else, and an ordinary one is refused.

Fixtures under `scenarios/<group>/<name>/` belong to the scenario `<group>/<name>`
and answer only while it is active, before any ordinary fixture: each active scenario
is a layer consulted before the ordinary fixtures, so a scenario fixture wins over an
ordinary one that names more headers or the exact body. Two fixtures for
the same request in one scenario, outside the scenarios, or in two scenarios active
together, are refused. A scenario may also hold `settings.json`, the `NCI_SI_*`
settings its server process starts with (a short timeout, a licence key); the settings
the harness makes itself (upstream URLs, mode, data directory) are refused, and so are
two scenarios active together that set the same one.

A fixture in a `concepts/` directory is a concept recording: EVS's answer to a
concept request, which `concepts.py` projects and batches by the rules the manifest
(`manifest.yaml`, `evs.concepts`) declares. A request no fixture answers exactly is
answered by those rules where the active recordings allow, a scenario's recording of
a code before the ordinary one. Every exact fixture is tried before the rules: an
ordinary one for a request the rules answer is refused, since it would answer before a
scenario's recording; an active scenario's exact fixture (a fault) answers before
another active scenario's recording, by design.

Every log entry records when the request arrived (`received_at`, monotonic seconds),
and the fixture or recordings that answered it.
