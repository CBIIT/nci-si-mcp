"""The project's requirements (`spec/requirements.yaml`) and the tests that cite them.

A suite test cites the requirements it enforces, `@pytest.mark.requirement("X-2")`. Every
requirement is cited by a test or planned in an issue, and every test cites requirements
the file holds; `selftests/test_requirements.py` checks both over the collected suite.
