"""Which suite a report comes from, and whether that suite is an approved release.

A report states the suite version, the fixture-set version and a digest over the suite's own
files. The report is an acceptance report only when the digest is one of those listed in
`acceptance/approved.yaml`; otherwise it reads MODIFIED. Changes to `spec/` and the suite need
written approval from the furnished tag (spec/acceptance.md), and this is how an unapproved
change shows: the digest moves and no approved entry carries it.

The digest covers the tests, the fixtures with their manifest, the register of request forms,
the harness and the pytest configuration with the dependency pins (`acceptance/pyproject.toml`),
and the specification data (`spec/`). It leaves out the self-tests, caches, editor and system
litter, the README and change log, the approval record itself, and the server under test, which
lives elsewhere: one approved suite attests any server.
