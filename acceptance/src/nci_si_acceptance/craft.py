"""Craft the scenario fixtures the live services do not produce on demand.

    pdm run acceptance-craft [--fixtures DIR]

Each scenario is built here, from the recorded set where it changes a real answer, so
that it follows a re-recording, or from scratch where it is synthetic. Every crafted
fixture names the requirement it stands in for. The self-tests check that the files
this writes are the ones in the fixture set. The scenarios recorded from live
(`release/unknown`, `batch/silent-drop`, `retired/with-replacement`, the refusal of
`license/restricted`) come from `record.py`.

Synthetic concepts use codes from C99000000 up, which NCIt does not use.
