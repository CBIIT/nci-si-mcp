"""A remote server under test: what the harness checks before the first test, and how it gets
the state a test needs from the operator's state-change hook.

The harness starts no process of a remote server and cannot set its environment, so the operator
sets the fixture server's URLs on it (`announcement`), `probe` makes sure it reaches them, and
`StateHook` runs the operator's `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_STATE_HOOK` command wherever a test needs a
server in another state (the acceptance README, "Remote server").
