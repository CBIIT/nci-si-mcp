"""The state-change hook of the self-tests that run the suite against a remote server: (re)start
the compliant server over streamable HTTP, as an operator's hook restarts a deployment.

It stops the server whose process id `RESTART_PID_FILE` holds, appends the scenario set it was
named, the licence key it was given (the scenario's setting, or none) and whether it was given the
harness's credential to the file `RESTART_RECORD` names, and starts the server again with its own
environment; then it returns at once, the server still starting, as a restart does.
