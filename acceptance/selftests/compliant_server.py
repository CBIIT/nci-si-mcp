    cadsr-unrelated-failure data element lookup sends Accept but fails all the same   (X-15)
    cadsr-no-accept   data element lookup leaves Accept out and reports the HTML    (X-15)
    cadsr-html-accepted data element lookup leaves Accept out and succeeds on HTML  (X-15)

`COMPLIANT_SERVER_CADSR=1` makes a data element lookup ask caDSR (`NCI_SI_CADSR_BASE_URL`) for
`/NCIAPI/1.0/api/DataElement/{publicId}`, naming Accept: application/json, and answer
upstream_unavailable where the body is no data element (HTML); without it every call asks EVS.

`COMPLIANT_SERVER_PAGE_SIZE` makes prompts/list, resources/list and resources/templates/list
page, that many items to a page with a nextCursor: a server that pages passes all the same (M6.1).

`COMPLIANT_SERVER_TRANSPORT=http` serves streamable HTTP on 127.0.0.1 at `COMPLIANT_SERVER_PORT`
in place of stdio, as a remote server. It answers 401 unless the Authorization header is
`COMPLIANT_SERVER_AUTHORIZATION` (where that is set), and appends the header of each request to
the file `COMPLIANT_SERVER_AUTH_LOG` names.

`COMPLIANT_SERVER_NO_CACHE=1` makes the server ask EVS again for a call it has answered.

`COMPLIANT_SERVER_PROFILE` names the profile the server serves, evs by default: the tools it
lists, the resources it serves and the prompts it lists (those whose every tool the profile
has, so none in evs). A resource's content is its tool's answer, called as spec/resources.yaml
says; a prompt's messages are its template with the arguments filled in.

`unpinned-mismatch` is no defect for a tool without a pinned form upstream: it answers an
unknown release with release_mismatch, as such a tool can only verify an unpinned answer (X-2).

A call asks EVS for `/api/v1/version`, or for the concept of a licensed terminology (or its
search, for a call that names no code) with the licence key, unless the same call was
answered before: the server caches by call, as A9.4 allows. An answer that is not content
is an error record: 404 release_not_available, another version than the release asked for
release_mismatch, a timeout timeout, anything else
upstream_unavailable; a 429 is waited out once. Content has items where the tool's `items`
say: the concept asked about and, at depth 1 for a traversal tool, one it reaches. What the
suite's calls (tests/calls.yaml) say of EVS's answers shapes it: their `upstream` fields go
into provenance, their `empty` arguments match nothing, their `truncating` arguments
reach a bound, and under their `paged` arguments a first page carries a cursor to a second,
of other concepts; the cursor carries the arguments it was issued for, as applied (an
optional argument left out as the default the specification states), and presented with
others it is refused. A bounded argument below one is refused, and an item carries the licence
text EVS's answer gives with the concept asked for, and none of its own.
